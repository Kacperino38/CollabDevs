<h1>Brief history About our university </h1>

<div class="spaces"></div>
 
<h2>Early history 1827 - 19 century </h2>
<h4>The University of Wolverhampton traces roots back to the 19th century, where it first started as a Mechanics Institute in 1827
  where the institute provided education and technical skills to the working class people during the industrial revolution. back then it was 
  called The Wolverhampton Mechanics Institute  and it was founded in 1827. In the latter part of the 19 century  this Institution grew even
  more and became the Wolverhampton Free Library and Technical College, expanding its educational offerings. by 1931 it had evolved into the
   Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Technical College expanding its curriculum filed into science, commerce and engineering. 
<h4>
<br>
<h2>Expansion into Polytechnic 1969 - 1992</h2>
<h4>In 1969 the institution was granted a polytechnic status and became known as the Wolverhampton Polytechnic. This great shift allowed the university to provide a wider range of higher education courses, this includes the  humanities, social sciences, and education and a traditional focus on science and engineering.
Throughout the 70s and 80s the University or also known as the Wolverhampton Polytechnic continued to grow and attracting more students and began to expand its facilities to promote new degree-level programs which allowed students to earn formal qualifications in specialized field at the time which was very sighting in the region. This time period in the universities history was marked by modernization efforts which allowed the institution to adapted to the new demands of the workforce and higher education sector.<h4>
<br>
<h2>University Status and Modern Growth 1992 – Present day <h2>
  <h4> near the end of the 20th century, national reforms allowed polytechnics to gain full university status in 1992, and the institution knowns as Wolverhampton Polytechnic officially became the University of Wolverhampton. This marked a new chapter in this institution’s history, now with more funding the institution expanded its research programs, postgraduate studies, and international collaborations.
  now in the present day, the university has grown into a multi-campus institution, offering education to over 21,000 students across a wide range of disciplines. The university has 3 major campuses. These campuses include City Campus located in Wolverhampton; this campus acts as a main hub of the university as majority of the subjects are taught here.

  <h2> Travel </h2>
  <h4>
    Traveling to the university to Wolverhampton can be expensive if u don’t live in an accommodation, 
    but we have ways that can be cheap and well-priced, many students complain about travel to the university as they many of them 
    live in cities like Birmingham, Coventry and Dudley . This can be challenge for those students as they must come on trains or 
    taxi which can be very expensive in the long run.

    <h2> Swift Card </h2>
  </a>
   <h4>
    Currently swift are giving away student discounts for their swift cards which help students get to the university faster and cheaper 
    than ordering a taxi or buying a rail card , we know this as students from Birmingham typically spend around £10.50 pounds per ticket
    to the university , which can cost up to £168 per month which can be very expensive for a student but with swift it typically costs around 
    £90 per month and you get access to not only train but you also get tram and bus with this card . we as the university of Wolverhampton 
    recommend that all our students coming from other cities should buy a swift card as it would save your money which can be invested in better equipment for your studies .
   </h4><br>

  <h2>How To Apply</h2> 
  <h4>
  Apply for a swift card can generally be easy all you require is a student id and your student finance details which swift use to confirm 
  that u are a student at the university which allows that to give you the student discount .How to cancel swift card , to cancel  the swift
  card all you need to do is to go on the app and website to cancel the swift cards direct debit or you can do it the old fashion way and phone
  them up , after cancelling the swift card you cannot restart the card or direct debit but instead you have to redo the whole scheme to confirm 
  that you are a student at this university to prevent fraud .
