<h1>Brief History About our University </h1>

<div class="spaces"></div>
 
<h2>Early History 1827 - 19th Century</h2>
<h4>The University of Wolverhampton traces its roots back to the 19th century, where it first started as a Mechanics Institute in 1827. The institute provided education and technical skills to working-class people during the Industrial Revolution. Back then, it was called The Wolverhampton Mechanics Institute and was founded in 1827. In the latter part of the 19th century, the institution grew even more and became the Wolverhampton Free Library and Technical College, expanding its educational offerings. By 1931, it had evolved into the Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Technical College, further expanding its curriculum to include science, commerce, and engineering.</h4>

<h2>Expansion into Polytechnic 1969 - 1992</h2>
<h4>In 1969, the institution was granted polytechnic status and became known as the Wolverhampton Polytechnic. This significant shift allowed the university to provide a wider range of higher education courses, including humanities, social sciences, and education, alongside its traditional focus on science and engineering. Throughout the 70s and 80s, Wolverhampton Polytechnic continued to grow, attracting more students and expanding its facilities. This growth enabled the university to offer new degree-level programs, allowing students to earn formal qualifications in specialized fields, which was an exciting development for the region. This period in the university’s history was marked by modernization efforts, allowing the institution to adapt to the evolving demands of the workforce and higher education sector.</h4>

<h2>University Status and Modern Growth 1992 – Present Day</h2>
<h4>Near the end of the 20th century, national reforms allowed polytechnics to gain full university status in 1992, and the institution known as Wolverhampton Polytechnic officially became the University of Wolverhampton. This marked a new chapter in the institution’s history, and with increased funding, the university expanded its research programs, postgraduate studies, and international collaborations. Today, the University of Wolverhampton is a multi-campus institution, offering education to over 21,000 students across a wide range of disciplines. The university has three major campuses:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>City Campus</strong> - Located in Wolverhampton, this campus serves as the main hub of the university where the majority of subjects are taught.</li>
    <li><strong>Walsall Campus</strong> - Specializing in sports education and health-related subjects.</li>
    <li><strong>Telford Campus</strong> - Known for its engineering and business programs.</li>
  </ul>
  The university has come a long way in its grand history, overcoming great challenges and struggles. Today, it stands as a major center of education in the West Midlands, continuing to lead in innovation, research, and offering a rich, diverse range of subjects.</h4>

<h2>Travel</h2>
<h4>Traveling to the University of Wolverhampton can be expensive, especially if you don’t live in university accommodation. Many students, especially those coming from cities like Birmingham, Coventry, and Dudley, find it challenging to manage the costs of travel, as they typically rely on trains or taxis, which can be very expensive over time.</h4><br>
 <h2> <a href="https://ticketsearch.tfwm.org.uk/#/?allowBus&allowTrain&allowMetro&passengerType=Student&timeBand=About%20a%20month&limit=6&limitExact=6#sbmBtn">Swift Card</a></h2>
<h4>Currently, Swift is offering student discounts for their Swift cards, which help students travel to the university faster and cheaper than using taxis or buying a railcard. For example, students traveling from Birmingham typically spend around £10.50 per ticket to get to the university, which can add up to £168 per month—quite expensive for a student. With the Swift card, however, the cost is typically reduced to around £90 per month, and the card grants access to trains, trams, and buses. We, at the University of Wolverhampton, highly recommend that all our students coming from other cities purchase a Swift card, as it can save you money that can be better invested in your studies.</h4>

<h2>How To Apply</h2>
<h4>Applying for a Swift card is simple. All you need is your student ID and your student finance details, which Swift uses to confirm that you are a student at the university. Once confirmed, you will receive the student discount. To cancel your Swift card, simply go to the app or website to cancel the direct debit, or you can contact them via phone. After cancellation, you will not be able to restart the card or direct debit, and instead, you must go through the entire application process again to confirm your student status to prevent fraud.</h4>
