<h2>Parking</h2>
<h4>We understand that parking can be a concern during busy events like the Open Day, but rest assured, there’s plenty of parking available. We have five parking garages near the university, all within walking distance—only about a 3-minute walk away. While the garages may seem hidden, they are conveniently located, so you shouldn’t have trouble finding a spot.</h4>

<h2>Travel</h2>
<h4>Traveling to the University of Wolverhampton can be expensive, especially if you don’t live in university accommodation. Many students, especially those coming from cities like Birmingham, Coventry, and Dudley, find it challenging to manage the costs of travel, as they typically rely on trains or taxis, which can be very expensive over time.</h4><br>
 <h2> <a href="https://ticketsearch.tfwm.org.uk/#/?allowBus&allowTrain&allowMetro&passengerType=Student&timeBand=About%20a%20month&limit=6&limitExact=6#sbmBtn">Swift Card</a></h2>
<h4>Currently, Swift is offering student discounts for their Swift cards, which help students travel to the university faster and cheaper than using taxis or buying a railcard. For example, students traveling from Birmingham typically spend around £10.50 per ticket to get to the university, which can add up to £168 per month—quite expensive for a student. With the Swift card, however, the cost is typically reduced to around £90 per month, and the card grants access to trains, trams, and buses. We, at the University of Wolverhampton, highly recommend that all our students coming from other cities purchase a Swift card, as it can save you money that can be better invested in your studies.</h4>

<h2>How To Apply</h2>
<h4>Applying for a Swift card is simple. All you need is your student ID and your student finance details, which Swift uses to confirm that you are a student at the university. Once confirmed, you will receive the student discount. To cancel your Swift card, simply go to the app or website to cancel the direct debit, or you can contact them via phone. After cancellation, you will not be able to restart the card or direct debit, and instead, you must go through the entire application process again to confirm your student status to prevent fraud.</h4>
